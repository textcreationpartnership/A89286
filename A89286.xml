            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>MAjor Generall <hi>Jones</hi> our Governour of this City of <hi>Dublin;</hi> and Commander, in chiefe of all the Forces of this province of <hi>Lemſter</hi> (to keepe the Souldiers in action, and deſtroy the Rebels quarters, and force them at a diſtance) deſigned a conſiderable ſtrength to march into the County of <hi>Wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="2" facs="tcp:160483:3"/>
The Rebels hearing of their deſigne, marched out of their quarters from ſeverall places, and (upon their neare approach) fled before them: The very noyſe of our men ſtrickes ſuch a terrour into the hearts of the Rebels, that they know not what to doe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing extreamly fearefull of being forced to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other engagement.</p>
            <p>So that our men have had very good ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſe in <hi>Wicklow,</hi> from whence they have brought very good prey of which I have ſent you a liſt (incloſed herein) of the particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars, by which you may ſee what a mighty booty God hath put into our hands.</p>
            <p>And if the Lord be pleaſed to ſettle you at peace at home, and reduce all the differen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces in <hi>England</hi> to an happy union, I doubt not but things will go well here, And our valiant Commander in cheife hath a deſigne by which he hopes to bring the Rogues low before Winter.</p>
            <p>Ordinary wheat is now (at Drogheda) at tenne ſhillings a Barrell, and dearer at Dublin.</p>
            <p>But ſuch care hath beene taken for provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions here; that Dublin have got in all their
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:160483:3"/>Harveſt; and that without danger, or inter<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ruption.</p>
            <p>The old Fox, Owen Ro-Oneale keepeth cloſe with his Forces about Kilkenny, he is there at one Houſe mending his Workes, and taking in proviſions, and will not fight but upon his owne conditions, if he could get a great advantage perhaps hee would make uſe of it, but before we come neare him he Alarmes his Forces to a withdrawing poſture.</p>
            <p>And the Iriſh have no other conſiderable ſtrength to depend upon.</p>
            <p>So that moneys comming firſt over to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courage our Souldiers, and then ſupplys of men and Equipage we have great hopes of a good forwardneſſe in reducing th<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
